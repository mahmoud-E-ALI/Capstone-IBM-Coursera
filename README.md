# Capstone-IBM-Coursera
Project background and context:
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.
